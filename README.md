Images and Data from the late Twitter bot @CaliforniaFlags
>>>
This repository contains the images and data used to create a now-deleted Twitter bot, @CaliforniaFlags. The Twitter bot, which was created in mid-June 2018, served one purpose, which was to tweet a different California municipal flag, seal, or logo every day at 11:13 Pacific Time. 
>>>
The format for the Tweets was [City Name],[County Name],[approximate population size] followed by the image of the day. 
>>>
The inital bot was also trained to recognize when a city seal or a city logo was used. In December 2018, the code was further adjusted to allow for cities such as West Sacramento that have no municipal symbol.
>>>
It was initially written so the bot tweeted in descending order based on approximate population sizes as of 2018. It could be adjusted to tweet in a different order.
